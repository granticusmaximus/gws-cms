One of the many questions when getting online is: Which is the best web hosting web company? The definition can vary dependent on what you mean by best. Do you mean the most reliable? The most affordable? The fastest? The company that can drive the most traffic to your site with little input from you? These are all legitimate questions, and hopefully I can point you in the right direction.

A website is a basic necessity for any small business, but you don't have to employ an army of IT pros to make it happen--let a web hosting service do the heavy lifting.

In a digital age marked by an always-on and always connected populace, your company's website often serves as the primary storefront for your business. Whether it is a site brimming with the latest technology that requires an army of IT professionals to maintain it or just a single webpage with contact information, your website is where you make that all-important first impression 

Fortunately, creating a functioning and inviting website does not have to be an expensive or time-consuming project. With the help of web hosting services, large and small businesses can project a public presence that is as professional and polished as a website produced by that army of IT pros mentioned earlier. For a small fee, a web hosting service can provide your business with a domain name and publish a credible, secure website that drives customers to your products and services. All it takes is a few mouse clicks, some basic information, and about an hour of your time.



### Who are the major players in web hosting? 

The basic definition of web hosting is about as straightforward as it gets: It is a service that provides the infrastructure that allows an organization to publish a website. A web hosting service generally charges a recurring fee that provides the subscribing entity with a domain name, storage for website pages, and a server that allows general access via the internet and a web browser.

There are dozens of reputable and viable web hosting services available globally; most offer a similar basic set of web hosting services, while some specialize in less crowded, and potentially more lucrative, niche markets. Choosing the right web hosting service for your small business will require research and careful consideration. 

Perhaps the most important factor when choosing a web hosting service is knowing exactly what your business needs from the provider. Most of the web hosting providers (whether listed below or not) will work with you to provide the service and features you request, but only if you can express those needs in a coherent way. 

This list of web hosting services presented in  **Table A** is in no particular order and only represents a sampling of available services. The features offered by each provider, as well as the cost of their services, changes over time, so it is important to do your own vetting before deciding which service works best for your business.

### **What should I know about choosing a web host?**

In order to be successful in the long term, a business must choose the best web hosting service for their particular set of circumstances. There are many criteria to consider when choosing a web hosting service; some are obvious and measurable (e.g., cost and guaranteed uptime), while other criteria (e.g., customer support) is more subtle and subjective. This TechRepublic cheat sheet will explain what web hosting is, why it could benefit your business, and what features you should consider when choosing your web hosting service partner. 

Advanced features like scripting support, shopping cart processing infrastructure, and guaranteed uptime will vary depending on the web hosting company. These additional and advanced features are what separate one web hosting service from another and will be the factors that determine which service is right for your business needs. 

The servers provided by web hosting services are generally classified into one of these four categories. 

* **Shared:** Probably the most common option for small businesses with minimal levels of traffic, shared hosting means that more than one website is stored on a single server or a single piece of hardware. Shared servers are often the least expensive option, which makes them appealing to startups and other small entrepreneurial businesses.
* **Dedicated:** When a single server plays host to a single website, it is called a dedicated server. This configuration allows the computer power of that server to be concentrated on just the website it is hosting. The dedicated server is usually more expensive than a shared server but that extra cost can be worth it to businesses where website performance is paramount to success.
* **Cloud hosting (VPS):** Similar to the shared server, virtual private servers (VPS) allows many websites to be hosted by one cloud-based server system. A VPS is essentially the cloud-based version of a shared server; however, because of the scalability, flexibility, and redundancy of cloud computing, the VPS can offer more features. A VPS is often a good choice for businesses with computational and feature requirements that fluctuate over time.
* **WordPress:** Physically speaking, a managed [WordPress](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/wordpress-the-smart-persons-guide/) server can be hosted by any of the three previously mentioned configurations; the difference is that a WordPress server is specifically designed and optimized to serve WordPress pages, which are often used by bloggers, journalists, and other content creators.

The type of web hosting server your business ultimately chooses will be dependent on your service requirements. A thorough assessment of your business needs with regard to your website should be made before you begin to consider any web hosting service. In addition, thought should be given to future needs and the potential for your chosen web hosting service to be accommodating and flexible. 

## Why is it important to choose the best web host? 

According to an infographic of internet facts published by [The Hosting Institute](https://thehostinginstitute.com/internet-facts-statistics/), there were 4.1 billion internet users in the world as of December 2018, and that number will continue to grow rapidly in the years to come. One of the best ways to reach those billions of potential customers is with a website, and the most efficient and least expensive way for a small business to get a website is through a hosting service. 

An early 2018 survey of 351 small business owners conducted by  [Clutch](https://clutch.co/website-builders/resources/small-business-websites-2018), showed that 64% of the respondents currently have a website. Importantly, of the approximately one-third respondents that currently did not have a website, some 58% plan to have a website by the end of 2018. The survey also revealed that 26% of the small businesses surveyed payed less than $500 to create and host their websites.

In this digital age, the website has become the public face of many organizations; it is often the way a business makes first official contact with a potential customer and is therefore extremely important for customer acquisition and retention. If your small business does not have a website, it is operating at a severe disadvantage to the competition that does. In the modern world, a website is basic standard operating procedure. 

By contracting with a web hosting service, small businesses can establish a digital presence with international reach without having to purchase hardware, install an operating system, deploy the proper web server software, write the required HTML, JavaScript, PHP, etc. code to build a functioning website, or hire the IT staff to maintain and secure all of that over time. With a web hosting service, a small business can concentrate on what it wants its website to look like and what information it wants to convey--all of the infrastructure maintenance and troubleshooting can be left to the professionals.
