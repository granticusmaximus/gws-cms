Here are five common mistakes new small business owners make - but they can be avoided if you know what they are ahead of time! 

1. **Hiring an unqualified employee.** It’s easy for any employer to hire someone who seems qualified on paper but just isn't the right fit. Especially when it comes to a small business owner with limited resources and hiring experience. This is why knowing exactly what you need from an employee and conducting thorough interviews with potential staff is essential. The wrong hire can be costly and drain your energy at a time when you should be focused on business growth.
2. **Underestimating your start-up costs**. Business owners are by nature creative and enthusiastic, which is why they decide to launch into the adventure of opening a new business in the first place. But their enthusiasm means that they tend to underestimate the start-up costs for their business and overestimate initial sales. This means that you can easily find yourself with a cash flow problem very early on in the game. By thoroughly [reviewing your start-up costs](https://www.forafinancial.com/blog/small-business/12-small-business-startup-costs-expect/) before you start doing business, you can be sure that you won’t be caught out if things take a little bit longer than you would have hoped to get running
3. **Registering your business entity incorrectly**. Knowing what the [preferred business setup](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikekappel/2021/04/28/business-structures-101-which-ones-the-best-fit-for-your-company/) for your company is can be tricky and technical. So if you’re not sure, reach out to a full-service formation company to steer you in the right direction. If a limited liability company (LLC) is the best choice for your business, for example, the formation company will not only provide the proper [forms to start an LLC](https://www.zenbusiness.com/llc/), they’ll also ensure you’ve met the legal registration requirements for your state.
4. **Leaving the books till year-end**. Let’s face it; few people actually like to do accounting, which is why this is one of the first areas that small business owners tend to outsource. But even if you have someone doing your books for you, they will still rely on your input and supporting documentation. And the more you [stay on top of it](https://www.finder.com/small-business-finance-tips) throughout the year, the less likely it is that you will miss something when it comes to filing your tax returns.
5. **Being unprepared for the unforeseen**. We plan a business for what is normal or usual. But we need to be prepared for the unusual. That’s why you must have a rainy day fund to cover anything out of the ordinary so that your business doesn’t fail at the first sign of trouble. And that’s why it’s worth considering [insurance policies](https://www.investopedia.com/best-small-business-insurance-4844202) for unexpected items that you will not be able to cover yourself, such as fire or other extraordinary events.

   And above all, don’t forget that there are plenty of resources available for you every step along the way. Don’t be afraid to ask questions or get help when necessary and try not to let any single thing overwhelm you. 

   Remember that this is a journey, and with some hard work, patience, and perseverance, you can make your entrepreneurial dreams come true!
