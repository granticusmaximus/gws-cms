I am taking a short break from writing product reviews for a moment to write a compiled list of tips and tricks backed by research for web design and development. This post will **NOT** be all inclusive, or contain everything you will need to know about web development. Rather, this article will cover a broad overview of ideas that I have come across over the 4 years I have worked in the industry, some of which I wish someone told me at the beginning when I was first starting out.

To go further, these will range from habits that we can develop to better ourselves as programmers and better employees for anyone. I have written two posts in the past about this subject, but it is always a good idea to stay objective about my own abilities and objectify my own work habits to see if I can better anything that I am doing to better my skills.

## Contribute to Open Source Projects:

If you are just starting out in the development field, or a season developer, contributing to open source projects gives you insight that is undeniably valuable to not only your skills as a developer, but also your soft skills. Working as a developer, whether in a team or as a single principal, working with others on open source teaches you one awesome thing: issue triage. There are many items working in open source teaches you, but learning how to collect issues in a group setting, and learning how to level each issue in importance is a great talent to have. This feature also forces the programmer to see their application in a broader term rather than just functions and .ToLists(). Contributing to open source projects gives new developers a general idea of the workflow of fixing errors and bugs while waiting on peer reviews for code merges, as well as working in small virtual standups in the triage process.

Working with open source also gives way to the prospect of peer recognition. Most people who are passionate about something strive to be recognized for the quality work they produce, and for some, developing software is a huge passion. Recognition from members from the OSS (open source software) community not only encourages and motivates a developer to improve his or her skills, it can also create a number of opportunities, such as job offers and invitations to attend conferences and events, etc.

Another important aspect of this point is self-recognition and personal achievement. Many developers are extremely determined to become the best developer they can be to meet certain personal goals, and having your code accepted by a big OSS project is a considered a massive achievement.

In the same way contributing to OSS can help you increase your chances of landing an internship, it can also improve your job and career prospects. Nowadays, when many tech companies receive a CV from a prospective developer, they usually skim over the sheets of paper and spend more time investigating the applicant’s Github account.

The fact that OSS is visible to the public means that prospective employers can inspect your code and assess your skills as a developer based on the code you have written. In contrast, commercial (proprietary) software doesn’t provide you with the same proof of your abilities, and overall it is much harder to gain experience in this realm.

While the increase in job prospects at big tech firms is one of the main effects of OSS contribution, there are also a number of other opportunities that can arise, such as consulting and freelance work.

## Teach and talk about what you know

There is a very distinct difference between information and knowledge. When a programmer is looking into any particular programming language, our first friend is Google. I am typically immediately overwhelmed with information, and sometimes it’s difficult to make the pilgrimage through the information to form the appropriate pathways to not only understand the language but to actually utilize it in a professional setting. This is where it is important to be in a network, albeit it may be personal or professional that you can share knowledge. In this particular field, I have come to realize, as you, reader of this article, should as well, people will know a skill that you are after. This sediment is true for you as well. There may be skills that you have that others lack. I wish for you to not be afraid of sharing the knowledge you have, or at least offering up to your team that you know a particular subject. Being prepared to teach someone a particular language, or pattern, or any area of your expertise also helps you with cementing those patterns and ideas in your own work.

Take for instance, whatever the language I am working in, I love taking the MVC model of writing code a step further with the repository pattern. Not only does it allow for me the ability to write clean code, but it also allows me to write one interface in one spot, that can be shared in multiple places throughout my code and manipulated in a very distinct fashion dependent of where I implement that interface. In one particular job that I had, the team did not have a “standard” for writing their code bases. Meaning one developer would write their code one way, and if something happened to that developer where they were out sick, took vacation, what have you, and something broke in the code that caused work stoppage, another developer would pick up the app to try and fix the issue. If you see where I am going with this, the new developer on the case is spending time just trying to understand where everything is in the code base, then they will be able to fix the issue. When I came on board, and one of the lead developers saw my code base, she loved my project structure, going as far as letting me teach the group my set up, and asking for consensus to make this our standard across the board. In doing so, regardless of who would pick up a piece of software, with a standard of structuring the code and following specific patterns within the code, any developer would be able to pick up and navigate the project to find a bug.

The last little tidbits of knowledge all slightly flow together in some format, so I am calling this last bit: The Arsenal!

Challenge yourself with a new skill in your current programming language. If you think you mastered a programming language, you may have not performed everything the language is able to do. And typically, especially if you work in C#, there are new iterations of the code base that has been updated, and you may want to utilize it in your apps.
