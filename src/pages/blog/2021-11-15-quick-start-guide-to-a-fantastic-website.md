The internet is a big place with a lot of websites [vying for attention](https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales). It’s essential, then, that you stand out from the crowd. Good web design can help you do just that, but what exactly goes into good web design and how can you make sure yours is on point?

Here’s a primer on good web design: what you ought to pay attention to and how you can help your business succeed.

## Pay attention to usability

Website usability is essential when it comes to maintaining customer attention. A clunky or hard-to-use interface can mean the difference between a sale and [a lost lead](https://www.go-globe.com/web-design-usability-statistics). When you’re designing your website, then, it’s all-important that you pay attention to usability.

Is your website easy to navigate? How many steps does it take to check out? Do you offer sign-ups for easier future transactions? You should be able to answer all these questions in a satisfactory manner.

## Know your brand

Building a website will mean very little if you don’t know what look and feel you’re aiming for. This is where knowing your brand is essential. You should be able to recognize your website as your own at a glance.

Sit down with your design team and nut out exactly what you want to say with your website. At the very least you ought to have a strong understanding of your brand colors, logo requirements, and font choices.

## Don’t neglect your copy

A beautiful website is all well and good, but it’s going to fail at its job if your website copy isn’t pulling its weight. When designing your website, make sure you’re not neglecting your web copy. It should be readable, engaging, and well laid out. 

Grammar and spelling mistakes can [cost you customers](https://writemysite.co.uk/13-copywriting-statistics-for-your-business/), so make sure everything is fully edited and polished. If in doubt, hire a professional copywriter to help you get the most out of your copy.

## Hire a professional

Professional web designers have made it their business to build sleek, effective websites. Why not lean on that experience? It may seem tempting to do everything yourself but the truth is, even the best automated website builder on the market is no match for a professional designer. You can save yourself a lot of headaches and get a higher quality result from hiring a [freelancer](https://www.developersforhire.com/web). 

When hiring a designer be sure to properly vet them. Check their references and thoroughly check through their portfolio. If a designer is too cheap to be true, you’re going to get what you pay for so be prepared to properly compensate your chosen worker.

## Pay your designers

This ought to be a given, but you’d be amazed how many companies underpay or inconsistently pay their designers. Whether you’ve hired under contract or put your new designer on payroll, you have to ensure they’re well compensated.

Payroll can be a complex affair with many moving parts, but it’s not impossible. By tapping into a reliable payroll service you can keep everything organized and running smoothly.

## Nail your web design

Good web design can make or break an online business. It all comes down to knowing your brand, paying attention to usability, and knowing when to hire a professional. Now you have a few tricks up your sleeve to help you nail your business’s web design.

## Attend to security

You’ve spent so much time getting to where you are … don’t stop until you’ve attended to the security of your website. Web security is crucial in order to prevent hackers from accessing sensitive information. If you’re open to learning this yourself, consider [earning a degree](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/bachelors-programs.html) in Network Operations and Security through an IT bachelor’s program. If you opt for online learning, you’ll be able to set your own schedule to make this feat feasible. If you haven’t the time or the interest, outsource security to a full service company to ensure your website is protected from top to bottom. Either way, you must have a proactive security strategy to mitigate the risk of malware and cyberattacks.
