The increasing demand for more functional apps has led to widespread interest in mobile app development, especially among the self-employed, and independent game developers. Anyone can create an app that could become the next smash hit, like, the indie game, Flappy Bird, which earned 50 thousand dollars every day, at the peak of its popularity, which led to a huge success for the small developer!

There are several areas of interest in the development of mobile applications that today's mobile app developers need to pay attention to. New technologies and old ones who are on their own feet, and with a spurt of new programming languages of 2021 has a lot in store for you, not only for consumers but also for the developers.

Here's what you need to know about it.

This means that mobile apps are becoming more and more in use in 2021 and, expected to increase at a later period.

**3. A growing number of on-demand apps**

On-demand apps are the ones that act as intermediaries between service providers and customers. In the world of apps, it is becoming more interesting in 2021, as more and more providers will offer on-demand apps in the marketplace. Uber and Taxify are a few of the companies that have recently gained a lot of popularity, with on-demand app services. Appinventiv, says that the on-demand app market reached $ 106.83 million in 2017. Technical analysts are saying that this is only going to grow in 2021 and beyond.

**4. Chatbots Will Have A Wide Field Of Application**

Recent trends in mobile apps, giving you that chatbots can occupy several lines of communications in the mobile app world. Part of the increased adoption of chatbots is due to the need for real-time interaction between the customers and the suppliers. It is important to keep in mind that this technology circumvents the need for human-to-human interaction.

Gartner claims that chatbots will be responsible for 85% of all customer interactions by the end of 2021. An interesting (or worrying) prediction is that the average person begins to interact more with chatbots than with their partners.

**5. Mobile app for supremacy, is growing**

Mobile technology is becoming more widespread all around the world. Statistics predicts that the number of wearable devices will reach 1029 million in 2022, out of 453 million in 2017. We have to assume that mobile devices and apps will soon be a part of your everyday life.

**6. Instant Apps will have to be paid**

Mobile apps are sure to remind you of their user-friendly and memory-efficient features. Instant apps are native apps that are more user-friendly, smaller and easier to use than traditional web apps. This is due to using instant apps, there is no need for downloading. As the name suggests, this app can be accessed without the need to launch a specific app.

With more and more users asking for a better user experience and faster page load times, instant apps will no doubt become more and more common in 2021, to reduce or eliminate the waiting period that is required for the installation of the app.

**7. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Will be used more widely**

Virtual reality and Augmented Reality will continue to stay in the market for some time, and 2021 will see more widespread adoption and proliferation of these technologies. Mobile app development trends show that AR and VR technology is not only for the improvement of the quality of the gaming and other apps, but it can also be used in several different use cases.

In 2021, you can expect to see a mobile app developer have a greater mobile experience in AR and VR, and more with compatible hardware on the market, and the party's just beginning.

Statista predicts that the global AR and VR market is expected to increase to $ 209 billion in 2022, up from $ 27 billion in 2018.

**8. Rapid Development Of the Mobile Pages (AMP) will Speed up**

The accelerated mobile pages (AMP) is an open-source initiative by Google, and Twitter, to enhance the performance of web pages on mobile devices. The technology of accelerated mobile pages will make it easier and faster to allow lightweight pages to load more quickly on smartphones and tablets. We have to assume that the mobile app developers in 2021 will be more active in the use of this technology to speed up the load time of your mobile devices.

**9. Mobile Payment Will Be Made**

As the demand for mobile apps, portfolios, programs and methods have increased significantly since 2019, this trend looks set to continue in 2021.

Further, the expansion of mobile payments is expected to occur in 2021.

**10. IoT Opens Up New Opportunities**

The IoT, or Internet of Things, is already well-established, and over the next five years, more than 5 billion people are expected to use IoT-related technology, in one

form or the other. Today, the Internet is available in the current mobile technologies, smart thermostats, smart light bulbs, dimmable lighting, etc.

The following year, the provisions of articles associated with the development of mobile apps, expect to see this technology soon be implemented in the mobile application development while providing a more personalized user experience across multiple devices.

**11. Cloud platforms will continue to grow**

No surprises! From an average consumer to a tech professional, they've all heard about the benefits of cloud-based technology and how it can help transform our collective lives.

**12. For business mobile apps are getting a new life**

It's no secret that more and more developers are leaning in the direction of the development of enterprise mobile applications. One of the main reasons for this is that these applications make it easy for you to communicate with a large team, and keep track of your important data and key performance indicators, which are almost required for both small and large businesses, now, to a certain extent.

43% of enterprise app developers are earning over $ 10,000 per month, as compared to 19% of the people involved in the development of customer-facing applications. Enterprise app stores are expected to be the next big thing, as well as more B2B interactions, and new engineers have a wealth of opportunities.

**13. Location-Based Wi-Fi Services Will Become A Commodity**

Mobile location services and Beacon technology have started to blur the boundaries between online and offline advertising, especially in the retail sector. Apple had already integrated the technology within iBeacon, and in 2016 Android followed their footsteps.

Over the years, the Wi-Fi network is not only used to provide access to the Internet, more and more public access points are also doubled down on a location for the access point. App developers need to follow this example, and the creation of apps that take advantage of services such as Wi-Fi internet access included, based on your current location.

**14. m-Commerce will be a major challenge**

As e-commerce giants such as Amazon, Myntra, Flipkart, eBay are examples of hugely successful m-Commerce apps, the development of the use of the m-Commerce app, can be expected to increase in the coming years. With a large number of smartphones, using technologies such as NFC, fingerprint recognition, etc., etc. Using a mobile device or a transaction, in particular, you will also find that you are ready to accept the fact that app developers can take advantage of m-Commerce applications that will be able to help provide additional functionality to the end-user.

**15. High-quality UX will be the norm of the day**

In addition to having a great look, smartphone users today expect their apps to be more intuitive and to provide more relevant content that best suits their likes and dislikes. In the upcoming periods, developers will have to focus on answering the customer's questions of whether the app is safe, secure, or too much of the user's rights, and so on.
