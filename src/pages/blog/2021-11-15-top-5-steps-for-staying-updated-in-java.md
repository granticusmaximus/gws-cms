It is very much important to update yourself in the tech industry like Java programming and it is quite simple to get stuck on the how or why and never to get around with anything. There are only a few tools needed along with ingredients for getting it done by following a simple recipe.

Instead of losing the expansive Twitter-verse or getting overjoyed by a good amount of developer blogs outside by taking into account these simple 5 step recipe for staying present in Java.

## 1) Equipment/Tools:

There are special stones used by the toasters for getting a yummy crust and plans to develop the perfect shape but the media we use for acquiring the right information on the screens are a practically nonrestricted resource for using to learn new developments or features for simply being engaged in the Java community.

Twitter: You can engage yourself with Java community which is a great tool. The next version of Java can be linked directly with the people and ask questions and get the reply. This is the best place for starting a conversation quickly with the people among the libraries and tools that are used.

Blogs: In the middle of a Google search, you can find the resources that are quite in the midst of a Google Search or via someone's Twitter. Favorite sites are collection into an RSS feed or simply save them in your bookmarks bar for simply catching up in between tasks or the bus to work on.

## 2) Ingredients or Resources:

From each of the tools, your ingredients will be quite apt with the resources for using them with each of the tools that have been covered in the past.

## 3) Dusting/ Keep it Light:

It is quite significant to bake the bread for using a light hand for dusting your work surface with flour and is quite same when delving within the online world of Java blogs and Twitter accounts and it is quite significant. For baking, too much flour leads to dry bread and in case it leads to burn it out completely.

It is not necessary that you must be a professional in the new technology that breaks every 2 seconds. A couple of topics are picked up by being relevant for the present job or future career aspirations for being interested personally.

## 4) Kneading or Working on it:

The flour and the liquid elements are joined together by Kneading which assists the dough for rising and establishing the bread's ultimate texture. For achieving the needed results there are various techniques similar to an analogous recipe.

For practicing your knowledge there are good ways like participating in Java User Group meetups and initiating or participating in an open source project on Github.

## 5) Baking and Fermentation or Lifelong Learning:

Similar to the knowledge's depth, here is where the dough begins to rise and finally we get to the final step in the bread-making process by placing it in the oven. Just be on the track and asking questions of course but stay a part of keeping your tactics well updated.

## Conclusion:

Baking a bread is not like being present in the programming language like Java. We are aware of it but it can be approached in the same fashion. Moreover, this mixture will give you new ideas for how to stay relevant in this in a fast-evolving industry.
