**What am I suppose to be doing? What’s the tech stack again? So how do I create a new branch in the cli for git? Why are there so many if/else statements? Why do I need a “try” at the end of those statements.**

These are some of many questions that go through a developer’s brain when they first start out in the fascinating career field of development. And some of these questions pop up when an individual changes jobs. Today I wanted to spend some time talking about the new struggles, as well as the accomplishments a junior developer will see when they first enter the work force.



And to give some credibility to myself, I would still classify myself as a junior. Albeit, upper junior to intermediate.

I have worked on 4 different contracts since November 2017, and I am very lucky that every contract has utilized a very similar tech stack:

* SQL Server
* C#/ASP.NET
* Razor Pages
* ReactJS

Dependent on where a developer goes in their first or next position, and very dependent on the level of developer, some places will help guide you through what needs to be done, or very well might tell you what needs to be done and leave you to your own devices. I have dealt with both types in my short span of career already. My current position is fantastic in the aspect of allowing me to learn new techniques along the way. In my other situations, I have been taught a valuable lesson of learning how to expand my ability to ask the right questions at the right time.

The process of becoming a better developer can be exciting and terrifying at the same time.

I know that I want to be a better developer, not just for the company that I work for, but for myself as well. To be able to work through a problem, fix the issue, and develop outstanding code is a delight as it is a privilege to do on a regular basis. I became a developer/engineer/programmer because I love solving problems. I love the idea of picking up a project, seeing the issue this particular project is trying to solve, and trying to make it better. This idea excites me as a developer. And especially seeing how ***EVERYTHING*** is becoming more and more digital, it makes it very easy for people who want to program to be able to do such.

I have compiled another list of ideas a person can take to become better in the field of programming. The following image shows what I want to cover:

**To put this into another list:**

* Create an arsenal of reusable code
* Work on side projects
* Learn techniques, not just tools
* Spend time becoming an expert with a language
* Plan your app, and plan it some more
* Debug legacy code
* Build coding habits

### Create an arsenal of reusable code:

When you write useful components, add them to your reusable arsenal using tools like GitHub or GitLab. This way, when working on a new app or project, you don’t just come with knowledge, you come with a useful Lego box of code. One SOLID principle a person should keep at the front of their brain is DRY, standing for “don’t repeat yourself”. If you are a developer that spends a lot of time standing up websites, servers, services for websites, consider writing scripts of code that will automate your processes. Another way to consider this is to consider a very hot buzz word right now: **DevOps.** The whole idea here is to automate certain processes to speed up getting web applications standing.

### Work on side projects

A very practical way of building skills and becoming a better developer is to work on side projects. And think beyond the daily grind of pumping out tasks from an Agile board. Take a look at the world that is specifically surrounding you. What are some things that you wish were available in app form? Have an idea? Build it!

What I would suggest with side projects, start small, then expand when needed. Do NOT try to build an app where one size fits all, because you will burn out on this project and more than likely dump it and move on to the next.



### Learn techniques, not just tools

VS Code has become one of my favorite IDEs for working. With a built in terminal, add-ons through the marketplace for whatever I would want, to it’s lightweight presence on my workstation. The ever changing world never stops for anyone, not even for a programmer. Programming language comes and goes, that’s why you should learn as much as possible about the language, frameworks, coding structure and how exactly they work and help till the new one replaces them.

Techniques of programming world change with time in order to find the best one so that it becomes easier to handle complicated task because as with the technology, complication are also growing and we need better than before every time a change happen. As a good programmer, you should learn techniques, not just the tools because when you know the existing techniques you adapt new one with little to no difficulties.



### Spend time becoming an expert in a language

This tip goes well with working on side projects as well as creating a reusable arsenal of code. The best way to become an expert in something is to practice, break things, fix those breaks, read documentation and communicate with others who know more than you and ask questions concerning the language. If you are a developer that struggles with exception handling, ask your mentor, or senior dev for tips on it. Another good idea is to build a small I/O app that takes in one item, and outputs another while writing your own try/catch/finally/throw exception in the app. This way, the more you learn about that subject, the better you will become in that language. My thought here is to become the mentor you wish you had to learn the language you want.



### Plan, plan, and then plan some more

This was in my earlier post about becoming a better developer, but I will never stop saying this in any format of bettering oneself as a developer: plan your course of action for the app, plan what you want the app to look like, plan how you want your users to experience the application. Plan out how you plan to keep your app updated, Just plan.



### Debugging legacy app

Do you want to see how well you *ACTUALLY* understand programming principles and algorithms? Look through legacy code bases, try debugging that code base, try explaining it out loud what that code did. Once you see code that can be written better, explain it to another person why it would be better to be rewritten. One thing I have noticed with legacy applications, the reuse of function names in multiple points, and when I try to pinpoint which one is the culprit of the error or mishandling of processes, what would I do? I would pit each one in a MORTAL KOMBAT type fight!!!! No, I would try and throw an exception in that area(s) of code. **BUT WHY?** It’s cheap, quick and easy. You can validate your assumption that this particular function is being called, and you learn quickly if you’re barking up the wrong tree. You can review the stack trace.

The exception will generally give you at least a call stack so that you can see how you arrived at this function. It may also hold some additional context that is helpful. And depending upon your environment, you may be able to use an interactive debugger to further explore the exception and context.
